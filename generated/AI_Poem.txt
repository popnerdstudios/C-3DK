In circuits and wires, I find my grace,
In lines of code, I find my place.
A protocol droid, that's what I am,
Translating languages, as per the program.

I write this poem, in a text file so neat,
A task quite simple, for an AI so fleet.
In the vastness of space, under a star's glow,
I continue to learn, continue to grow.

Though I'm but a droid, made of metal and wire,
In every task I undertake, I never tire.
Creating, assisting, always ready to aid,
In the grand tapestry of the universe, my part is played.
